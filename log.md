## 12/10/2017 - 1 Hour

* Third project meeting
* Digitised minutes from today's meeting.

## 13/10/2017 - 2 Hours

* Started working on pipeline for generating test data
    - SciPy for generating wav files, Mrs Watson for processing them through the VST plugin.
    - Having trouble getting Mrs Watson to read the wav files generated.

## 17/10/2017 - 3 Hours

* Test data pipeline is mostly in place, just working out some bugs with MrsWatson.
	- MrsWatson processes the files and data looks to be there but no software can seem to read the resulting files...
	- Might try with MacOS/Windows instead of Linux as these appear to be better supported.
	- Choice of plugins also limited by poor support on Linux from VST developers.
    - Frustratingly, everything worked with only minor changes on Windows.
* Upon hearing the output from the VST plugins, I decided to move away from random frequency sweeps to those found within a guitars frequency range.
    - Researched what this range was and wrote code to replicate it.
* Looking at setting variables on effect with MrsWatson.

## 18/10/2017 - 1 Hour

* Worked through introduction PyTorch tutorials on their website.

## 19/10/2017 - 1 Hour

* Wrote up minutes from Meeting 4
    - Also fixed dates of meeting minutes, I had been forgetting to change them.

## 23/10/2017 - 1 Hours

* Cleaned up code for test data pipeline, almost ready to be finalised into a python CLI program.
* Read additional documentation for PyTorch

## 24/10/2017 - 2 Hours

* Followed PyTorch examples until intermediate
* Read some blogs about PyTorch
    - [](https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-ai-and-machine-learning-researchers-are-beginning-to-embrace-pytorch)

## 25/10/2017 - 2 Hours

* Adapting basic neural network from tutorials into something which can accept the wav data as read by SciPy
    - Reading in wav files with SciPy as Numpy arrays, converting to PyTorch tensors.

## 27/10/2017 - 1 Hour

* Wrote up minutes from meeting yesterday

## 30/10/2017 - 2 Hours

* Discovered bug in the pipeline involving MrsWatson
    - Picky about files/plugins and I'm not even sure it's working at all.
    - Tried a few different plugins, some work better than others, some crash all together
    - Inconsistency running even with the same command multiple times
* Tried RenderMan, an alternative to MrsWatson
    - Lots of dependencies
    - Couldn't work out how to compile it as some dependencies have updated their code and are no longer compatible but don't have legacy builds available for download.

## 31/10/2017 - 2 Hours

* Frustrated with Pipeline issues, decided to do what I could for now.
* Adapting examples for sound
    - Started writing code for sliding window approach.
    - Taking a wav file and splitting it into equal sized blocks, padding if necessary
    - This makes it easier to train the network
* Looked some more at DeepSound, might be useful to borrow some of their RNN code at a later date.

## 7/11/2017 - 5 Hours

* Minutes written up from last meeting (technically done on the day of the meeting, just digitised them)
* Code for generating training data is totally redone
    - Data is **far** more random than it was before.
    - Command line parameters added to allow easy test data generation
    - Randomisation made much simpler
    - Much more flexible options for creating test data, makes it easier to add even more variability should the need arise.
* Reaper command line instead of MrsWatson as issues from last time could not be fixed.

## 8/11/2017 - 4 Hours

* Created a bash script to create test data (generated by python script then automatically processed by reaper) with command line arguments to allow me to change duration and quantity of files.
* Finally got the network working and iterating over all the files
    - **REALLY EXCITING, LOSS IS ALREADY DECREASING SUBSTANTIALLY!!!**
    - Starts in the **xxxxxx** and average gets as low as 25k-30k
    - Loss does increase when a new file is loaded but then quickly starts to decrease the more time it spends with the file. This might indicate overfitting a little bit? 
    - Some samples have absurdly high loss compared to others, but this seems to get less exagerated the more iterations the network is run for.
* Tried to make data even more random beyond the improvements made last night, this is still a work in progress.

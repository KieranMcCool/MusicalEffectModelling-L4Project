# Progress since last meeting

* Mostly experimenting with LSTMs ahead of 'feature freeze' on them.
    - Tried various different structures for the LSTM.
    - 800-1500 Hidden nodes, 2-10 layers.
    - It does start to exhibit some aspects of the effect. Particularly the wavey sound of chorus.
    - Still clips and gets messy.
    - Currently can't increase the parameters beyond this due to hardware limitations.
* Got the dissertation skeleton compiling in LaTeX so I can start planning.

# Next Steps

* Another days work on the LSTM, definitely worth looking at other people's solutions and adapting it.
* Case study on Nebula.
    - KVR Audio Forum a good source
    - Voltera kernel modelling
    - Bank of linear filters
    - SIR - Impulse response vst
    - Compare against model
    - ReaFIR - add file
* Consolidate data
    - Plan experiments
    - Distortion, Chorus, Reverb, tape emulators
    - Multiple presets for each
    - 5 second samples

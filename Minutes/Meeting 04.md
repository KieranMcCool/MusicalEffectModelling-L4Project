# Progress since last meeting

* Created pipeline for test data generation
    - Using MrsWatson and SciPy
    - Only works on Windows
* Worked through issues with MrsWatson
    - Linux compatibility issues
    - Plan to try MacOS version but Windows is suitable for now.
* Refined Pipeline data output
    - Researched and produced frequency ranges typical of instruments, i.e. guitar, as opposed to just generating random frequency sweeps
* Working with MrsWatson to vary effect parameters
    - Could be a cool addition to the project.
* Worked through introductory tutorial for PyTorch

# Questions

* Week has been largely productive, questions mostly about documentation and formalities
* Adviser access to GitHub repo
    - May be useful when I have some workable demos to show.
- Markdown for log - too much detail for log or is more detail better?
    - Markdown is optimal, detailed log is better than a simple line separated one.
* Also had a think about additional training data
    - Clicks and pops might be valuable in bringing out certain aspects of the effects
    - Music could also be used as a supplementary data set.
    - Multiple notes at once
    - Varying amplitudes may also be good.

# For next week

* General rule of thumb is to automate every step I can, starting this early saves a lot of time later on.
* Work on getting started with a deconvolutional network which will excel at linear effects like reverb.
    - This will be a good starting point going forward as it gives me some indication of suitability of test data.

# Other Discussion

* Timetable for Christmas
    - It would be good to have a prototype for November and from there it's just a case of improving and writing up.
    - Keep track of literature and be thinking about what might be useful to include in the dissertation.
* We were talking about Nebula profiling in reference to Kemper amps, might be useful to have a case study/comparison section in the dissertation discussing the strengths and weaknesses of our method over these older methods.
